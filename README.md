# ML-Mini-Project---Logistic-regression-on-the-titanic-dataset

# Logistic-regression-on-the-titanic-dataset

# INTRODUCTION

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous
shipwrecks in history.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts
of people were likely to survive.

In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to
predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

# GOALS AND OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this project is to document the process I
went through to create my predictions for Titanic
Survivor Prediction.

The objective of this project was to build a classification
model that could successfully determine whether a
Titanic passenger lived or died.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

TOOLS USED

1. Anaconda Navigator- 1.9.6
2. Jupyter Notebook- 5.7.4

LIBRARY USED

1. Analyzing: Numpy, Pandas , Sci-kit Learn
2. Visualization : Matplotlib , Seaborn

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification
algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or
output), y, can take only discrete values for given set of
features(or inputs), X.

Some of the examples of classification problems are Email
spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud.
